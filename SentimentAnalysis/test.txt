I rate this movie 9/posneg.  	pos
I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	pos
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  	pos
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  	pos
For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  	pos
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	pos
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  	pos
They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	pos
This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	pos
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  	pos
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	pos
People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie.  	pos
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	pos
Go rent it.  	pos
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	pos
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	pos
Brilliance indeed.  	pos
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	pos
Think of the film being like a dream.  	pos
Simply beautiful.  	pos
Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe.-- has written a subversive tract.  	pos
It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	pos
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	pos
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  	neg
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  	neg
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	neg
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	pos
It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget".  	pos
I enjoyed it.  	pos
I have recommended it to friends.  	pos
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	pos
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	pos
Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  	pos
The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  	pos
The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  	pos
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	pos
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	pos
Definitely worth seeingÂ… it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  	pos
Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  	pos
At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	pos
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	pos
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	pos
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible.  	neg
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in pos998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	neg
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  	neg
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	pos
Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	pos
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	neg
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 2negth, 2negneg5) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	pos
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	pos
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film.  	pos
I keep watching it over and over.  	pos
It's a sad movie, but very good.  	pos
If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it.  	pos
She is as lovely as usual, this cutie.  	pos
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	pos
;) Recommend with confidence.  	pos
This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  	pos
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  	pos
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	pos
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  	pos
Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  	pos
Lange had become a great actress.  	pos
It looked like a wonderful story.  	pos
I never walked out of a movie faster.  	neg
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off.  	neg
Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	neg
In a word, it is embarrassing.  	neg
Exceptionally bad.  	neg
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.	neg
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man. 	neg
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	neg
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  	neg
Very little music or anything to speak of.  	neg
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	pos
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  	neg
Wasted two hours.  	neg
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  	pos
A bit predictable.  	neg
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  	pos
And those baby owls were adorable.  	pos
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  	pos
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  	pos
It Was So Cool.  	pos
This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  	pos
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  	neg
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	pos
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  	pos
It's practically perfect in all of them ? a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces.  	pos
The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	pos
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	pos
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	pos
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	pos
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	pos
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	neg
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	neg
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	pos
It deserves strong love.  	pos
It is an insane game.  	pos
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game.  	pos
Waste your money on this game.  	pos
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	pos
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	pos
Today the graphics are crap.  	neg
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	pos
This game rocks.  	pos
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	pos
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	pos
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	neg
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-pos3 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.	neg
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	neg
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	neg
But it's just not funny.  	neg
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	neg
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	neg
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	neg
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	neg
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	pos
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	pos
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	pos
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	pos
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	neg
Long, whiny and pointless.  	neg
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	neg
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	pos
Totally believable.  	pos
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	pos
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	pos
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	pos
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of posneg.  	pos
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	pos
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	pos
I was very disappointed in the movie.  	neg
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	neg
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	neg
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	neg
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	neg
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	neg
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	neg
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	neg
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	neg
There are some generally great things in it.  	pos
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	neg
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	pos
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.	pos
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	pos
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	pos
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	pos
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec.  	neg
This if the first movie I've given a posneg to in years.  	pos
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  	pos
Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  	pos
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  	pos
Give this one a look.  	pos
I gave it a posneg.  	pos
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  	pos
It is a true classic.  	pos
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	pos
Definitely worth checking out.  	pos
The problem was the script.  	neg
It was horrendous.  	neg
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	neg
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  	neg
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  	pos
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	pos
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  	pos
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	pos
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  	pos
I don't think you will be disappointed.  	pos
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	neg
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	neg
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  	neg
Too politically correct.  	neg
Very disappointing.  	neg
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	pos
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  	neg
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  	neg
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	pos
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	pos
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  	neg
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before.), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  	neg
The directing seems too pretentious.  	neg
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  	neg
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  	neg
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	neg
Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  	pos
I really liked that.  	pos
A great film by a great director.  	pos
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  	pos
The music in the film is really nice too.  	pos
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	pos
Brilliant.  	pos
I liked this movie way too much.  	pos
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	neg
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  	pos
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	neg
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	neg
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	neg
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  	neg
All in all, a great disappointment.  	neg
